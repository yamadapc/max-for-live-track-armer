# Max for Live Track Armer
![](/demo.gif)

_Ableton Live_ has no way of using a single button to arm the next/previous
track to record. This is useful so you can have "up"/"down" pedals/keys mapped
to switching the armed track to change the current effects rack applied to your
monitored sound.

This is my first Max for Live patch, which is very rough in organization and
features; all feedback in those respects would be great.
